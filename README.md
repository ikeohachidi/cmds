# Cmds
Rewriting some linux commands in go
I have no intention of making this a one-to-one recreation of these commands but hopefully can
make them similar feeling enough.

#### Why?
Just for practice.

#### Done
- [x] ls
- [x] pwd
- [x] cp
- [ ] mv?
- [x] rm
- [x] mkdir
- [ ] tail
- [ ] head
- [ ] touch
- [ ] man?
- [ ] echo?
- [ ] cat
- [ ] ping
